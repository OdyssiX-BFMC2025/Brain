# BFMC - Brain Project

The project contains all the provided code for the RPi, more precisely:
- Firmware for communicating with the Nucleo and control the robot movements (Speed with constant current consumption, speed with constant speed, braking, moving and steering);
- Firmware for gathering data from the sensors (IMU and Camera);
- API's for communicating with the environmental servers at Bosch location;
- Simulated servers for the API's.
